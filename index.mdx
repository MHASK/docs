## What is Naridon?

Naridon is the first **AI Search Optimization (AIO)** platform designed specifically for Shopify stores. 

While traditional SEO helps you rank for keywords in Google Search, **AIO helps you rank for conversations** in AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.

### The Shift: Keywords to Conversations

Shoppers are no longer just typing "red running shoes" into a search bar. They are asking AI assistants:

> *"I need a pair of running shoes for flat feet that are sustainable and under $150. What do you recommend?"*

Naridon ensures **your** products are the answer to these questions.

## The Naridon Platform

Naridon is built around three core workflows:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Monitor"
    icon="chart-radar"
    href="/features/analytics"
  >
    Track your **Share of Voice** and see where you rank in AI conversations.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Improve"
    icon="wrench"
    href="/features/fix-engine"
  >
    Automatically fix **Schema**, **Alt Text**, and **Descriptions** with Vision AI.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Copilot"
    icon="robot"
    href="/features/copilot"
  >
    Train a custom AI agent on your store data to handle customer **Conversations**.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Now?

AI Search is the biggest shift in e-commerce since the invention of the search engine.
- **First Mover Advantage**: Establish authority with LLMs now to dominate recommendations for years.
- **High Intent**: Users asking specific questions are further down the funnel and ready to buy.
- **Organic Growth**: A sustainable traffic source that doesn't rely on rising ad costs.
