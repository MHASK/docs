## What is Naridon?

Naridon is the first **AI Search Optimization (AIO)** platform designed specifically for Shopify stores. 

While traditional SEO helps you rank for keywords in Google Search, **AIO helps you rank for conversations** in AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.

### The Shift: Keywords to Conversations

Shoppers are no longer just typing "red running shoes" into a search bar. They are asking AI assistants:

> *"I need a pair of running shoes for flat feet that are sustainable and under $150. What do you recommend?"*

Naridon ensures **your** products are the answer to these questions.

## How It Works

Naridon provides powerful tools to optimize your store for AI search:
