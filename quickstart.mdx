## 3-Step Onboarding

Naridon features a streamlined onboarding process designed to get you results in under 2 minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Silent Scan">
    Immediately after installation, Naridon runs a background "Silent Scan." 
    It analyzes your metadata and calculates a **Visibility Snapshot** before you even configure a setting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt Selection">
    Tell us what you want to rank for.
    - **Choose**: Select from high-value customer questions we identified during the scan.
    - **Custom**: Write your own target questions (e.g., *"Best vegan leather boots under $200"*).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automation Mode">
    Select your comfort level:
    - **Suggest Only**: You review every change.
    - **Assist Mode**: We handle the small stuff; you handle the big stuff.
    - **Full Autopilot**: We optimize your store aggressively for maximum growth.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once onboarded, head to the **Monitor** tab to see your initial rankings, or the **Improve** tab to start fixing product gaps.
