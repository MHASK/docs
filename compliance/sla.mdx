## 1. Uptime Commitment

Naridon is committed to providing a reliable service. We aim to maintain a Service Availability of at least **99.9%** during any monthly billing cycle.

## 2. Service Availability Definition

**"Service Availability"** is calculated as the total number of minutes in a calendar month minus the number of minutes of Unavailability, divided by the total number of minutes in the calendar month.

**"Unavailability"** means that the Naridon App or API is inaccessible to the Customer or is unable to process requests.

Unavailability **excludes** issues caused by:
- Scheduled maintenance (with prior notice).
- Factors outside our reasonable control (Force Majeure events).
- Failures of the Shopify platform or third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI/Anthropic outages).
- Customer's equipment, software, or network connections.

## 3. Scheduled Maintenance

We perform regular maintenance to ensure the security and performance of the platform.
- We aim to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours (typically weekends or late night UTC).
- We will provide at least 24 hours' notice for any scheduled maintenance that is expected to cause downtime.

## 4. Support Response Times

While not a guarantee of resolution, we aim to respond to support inquiries within the following timeframes:

| Priority | Description | Target Response Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Urgent** | Service is down or critical features are unusable. | < 4 Hours |
| **High** | Significant feature degradation but workaround exists. | < 24 Hours |
| **Normal** | General questions, feature requests, or minor bugs. | < 48 Hours |

## 5. SLA Credits

This SLA is a policy statement and does not automatically grant financial credits for downtime unless explicitly specified in a customized Enterprise Enterprise agreement.

For standard plans, significant downtime may be compensated with service credits at our sole discretion. Please contact support if you believe you have been affected by extended unavailability.
