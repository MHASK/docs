## 1. Introduction

Naridon ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you install and use our app in connection with your Shopify store.

## 2. Information We Collect

### Information from Shopify
When you install Naridon, we are automatically able to access certain types of information from your Shopify account:

- **Shop Data**: Store name, domain, email, and settings.
- **Product Data**: Titles, descriptions, prices, images, and inventory levels (to power the AIO Engine).
- **Customer Data**: We process customer data only as required to provide search and analytics features (see our [GDPR policy](/compliance/gdpr) for details).

### Information You Provide
- Correspondence when you contact support.
- Configuration settings you select within the app.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide and maintain the Service (e.g., indexing your products for AI models).
- Analyze usage to improve our algorithms and features.
- Provide customer support.
- Communicate with you about updates and billing.

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with the following categories of third parties to provide the Service:

- **Sub-Processors**: We use trusted third-party providers for hosting, database, and AI inference. All sub-processors are vetted for security and compliance, with Zero Retention policies applied where applicable.
  - See our [GDPR & Data Security](/compliance/gdpr) page for more details.

- **Shopify**: To integrate with your store and process billing.
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law or to protect our rights.

## 5. Data Retention

- **Store Data**: Retained as long as the app is installed. Upon uninstallation, data is deleted in accordance with Shopify's retention policies.
- **Analytics Data**: Retained for a specific period to provide historical insights, then anonymized.

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including accessing, correcting, or deleting your data.
- **Merchants**: You can access and update your data via the Shopify Admin.
- **Customers**: We support Shopify's standard data protection processes for customer data requests and deletion.

## 7. Security

We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256), to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
