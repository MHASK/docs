## 1. Commitment to Data Privacy

Naridon, operated by **Thom & Co GmbH** (Switzerland), is fully committed to compliance with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)**. We prioritize the security and privacy of both our Merchants and their End-Customers.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

It is crucial to understand our role in processing data:

- **Merchant Data**: When you (the merchant) install Naridon, we act as a **Data Controller** for your account information (name, email, billing details).
- **End-Customer Data**: When we process your store's customer queries or search history, we act as a **Data Processor**. You remain the **Data Controller**. We process this data solely on your instructions.

## 3. Lawful Basis for Processing

We process personal data only when we have a lawful basis to do so, in accordance with Article 6 GDPR.

| Data Type | Purpose | Lawful Basis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account Information** | To provide the Naridon App service, manage billing, and authentication. | **Contractual Necessity** (Art. 6(1)(b)) |
| **Product Data** | To index and optimize your store's catalog for AI models. | **Contractual Necessity** (Art. 6(1)(b)) |
| **Customer Queries (Search)** | To provide AI search results and analytics to the merchant. | **Legitimate Interest** (Art. 6(1)(f)) & **Contractual Necessity** |
| **Usage Logs** | To ensure security, debug issues, and improve app performance. | **Legitimate Interest** (Art. 6(1)(f)) |
| **Marketing Comms** | To send product updates or offers. | **Consent** (Art. 6(1)(a)) |

## 4. International Data Transfers

As a modern SaaS application, we utilize cloud infrastructure that may be located outside of Switzerland/EU (specifically the USA). To ensure your data remains protected, we rely on the following safeguards:

- **Adequacy Decisions**: For transfers to countries recognized by the EU/Switzerland as providing adequate protection.
- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**: For transfers to providers in the USA (e.g., OpenAI, Supabase), we enter into DPA agreements incorporating the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
- **Data Privacy Framework**: Where applicable, we prioritize vendors participating in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.

## 5. Sub-Processors

We use the following third-party sub-processors to provide our service.

| Sub-Processor | Role | Location | Safeguard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shopify** | E-commerce Platform & Identity | Canada (Adequate) / Global | Adequacy / SCCs |
| **Vercel Inc.** | Cloud Hosting & Edge Functions | USA | SCCs |
| **Supabase Inc.** | Database & Vector Storage | USA (AWS East) | SCCs |
| **OpenAI, LLC** | LLM Inference (Zero Retention) | USA | SCCs |
| **Anthropic, PBC** | LLM Inference (Zero Retention) | USA | SCCs |

*Note: We have signed specific "Zero Data Retention" agreements with our AI providers where available, ensuring they do not use your data to train their models.*

## 6. Data Subject Rights

1.  **Right of Access**: Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
2.  **Right to Rectification**: Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.

## 7. Technical & Organizational Measures (TOMs)

We implement state-of-the-art security measures to protect data:

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ encryption for all data moving between Shopify, our servers, and the client.
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all database volumes and backups.

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: Internal access is restricted to engineering staff with a specific business need.
- **MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication is enforced for all administrative access.

### Availability & Resilience
- **Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery.
- **Redundancy**: Critical services are deployed across multiple availability zones.

## 8. Data Breach Notification

In the event of a personal data breach, we will notify:
- The competent supervisory authority within **72 hours**, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms.
- Affected controllers (Merchants) without undue delay, providing sufficient information to allow you to meet your own notification obligations.
