## Data Protection Overview

Naridon acts as a **Data Processor** for the personal data of your customers. You, the merchant, are the **Data Controller**. We process data only on your behalf and in accordance with your instructions (via the Shopify API).

## Technical Security Measures

### Encryption
- **Data in Transit**: All data transmitted between your Shopify store, our servers, and third-party LLM providers is encrypted using **TLS 1.2+** (Transport Layer Security).
- **Data at Rest**: All database volumes and backups are encrypted using **AES-256** encryption standards.

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Our infrastructure is hosted on secure, enterprise-grade cloud providers with SOC 2 Type II certification.
- **Access Control**: Access to production data is restricted to authorized engineers on a strictly need-to-know basis, protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## GDPR Compliance

We are fully committed to GDPR compliance. Here is how we support your obligations:

### 1. Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)
When a customer requests data deletion via your Shopify Admin:
- Shopify notifies us through their standard data deletion process.
- We automatically identify all chat logs, analytics, and session data associated with that customer.
- We purge this data from our systems promptly in accordance with GDPR requirements.
- We confirm the deletion to Shopify.

### 2. Right to Access
If a customer requests a copy of their data:
- Shopify notifies us through their standard data request process.
- We compile an export of all conversations and interactions stored for that customer.
- This is returned to Shopify to be forwarded to the customer.

### 3. Data Minimization
We only store data required to provide the service:
- **Product Data**: To power the search index.
- **Anonymized Analytics**: Aggregate counts of searches and clicks.
- **Chat Logs**: Retained for a limited period to allow for quality improvement and analytics, then anonymized.

## Sub-Processors

Naridon uses the following third-party sub-processors to provide our service. All sub-processors are vetted for security and compliance.

| Sub-Processor | Purpose | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shopify** | E-commerce Platform & Auth | Canada / Global |
| **AI Service Providers** | LLM Inference (Zero Retention) | Various |
| **Cloud Infrastructure Providers** | Hosting & Database | Global |

*> Note: We have opted out of data training with our LLM providers. Your store data is NOT used to train OpenAI or Anthropic models.*

## Incident Response

In the event of a data breach, Naridon has an Incident Response Plan in place.
- **Detection**: 24/7 monitoring of infrastructure.
- **Notification**: We will notify affected merchants promptly in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.
