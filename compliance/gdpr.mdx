## Data Protection Overview

Naridon acts as a **Data Processor** for the personal data of your customers. You, the merchant, are the **Data Controller**. We process data only on your behalf and in accordance with your instructions (via the Shopify API).

## Technical Security Measures

### Encryption
- **Data in Transit**: All data transmitted between your Shopify store, our servers, and third-party LLM providers is encrypted using **TLS 1.2+** (Transport Layer Security).
- **Data at Rest**: All database volumes and backups are encrypted using **AES-256** encryption standards.

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Our infrastructure is hosted on **Vercel** and **Supabase** (AWS), located in secure data centers with SOC 2 Type II certification.
- **Access Control**: Access to production data is restricted to authorized engineers on a strictly need-to-know basis, protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## GDPR Compliance

We are fully committed to GDPR compliance. Here is how we support your obligations:

### 1. Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)
When a customer requests data deletion via your Shopify Admin:
1. Shopify sends a `customers/redact` webhook to Naridon.
2. Naridon automatically identifies all chat logs, analytics, and session data associated with that customer.
3. We purge this data from our systems within **72 hours**.
4. We confirm the deletion to Shopify.

### 2. Right to Access
If a customer requests a copy of their data:
1. Shopify sends a `customers/data_request` webhook.
2. We compile a JSON export of all conversations and interactions stored for that customer ID.
3. This is returned to Shopify to be forwarded to the customer.

### 3. Data Minimization
We only store data required to provide the service:
- **Product Data**: To power the search index.
- **Anonymized Analytics**: Aggregate counts of searches and clicks.
- **Chat Logs**: Retained for **30 days** to allow for quality improvement and analytics, then anonymized.

## Sub-Processors

Naridon uses the following third-party sub-processors to provide our service. All sub-processors are vetted for security and compliance.

| Sub-Processor | Purpose | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shopify** | E-commerce Platform & Auth | Canada / Global |
| **OpenAI** | LLM Inference (Zero Retention) | USA |
| **Anthropic** | LLM Inference (Zero Retention) | USA |
| **Vercel** | Hosting & Edge Functions | Global |
| **Supabase** | Database & Vector Store | USA (AWS) |

*> Note: We have opted out of data training with our LLM providers. Your store data is NOT used to train OpenAI or Anthropic models.*

## Incident Response

In the event of a data breach, Naridon has an Incident Response Plan in place.
- **Detection**: 24/7 monitoring of infrastructure.
- **Notification**: We will notify affected merchants within **48 hours** of becoming aware of a confirmed breach involving personal data.
