## AI Guardrails

Naridon implements strict guardrails to ensure that AI interactions are safe, accurate, and on-brand.

### 1. Hallucination Prevention
We use a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture that grounds all AI responses in your actual store data.
- **Fact-Checking**: The AI is explicitly instructed to only answer questions based on the provided product catalog and knowledge base.
- **"I Don't Know" Fallback**: If the AI cannot find an answer in your data, it is trained to admit it politely rather than inventing information.

### 2. PII Redaction
To protect your customers' privacy, Naridon automatically detects and redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before sending data to any LLM.
- **Redacted Fields**: Email addresses, phone numbers, and credit card patterns are masked in logs and processing pipelines.
- **Compliance**: This ensures compliance with GDPR and Shopify's data protection requirements.

### 3. Brand Safety & Tone
You have control over how the AI speaks to your customers.
- **Profanity Filters**: Strict filters prevent the AI from generating or engaging with offensive language.
- **Competitor Blocking**: The AI is trained not to discuss or recommend competitor brands, even if asked directly.
- **Tone Enforcement**: Whether you choose "Professional" or "Friendly," the AI adheres to system prompts that enforce your specific brand voice.

## Data Privacy

We take data stewardship seriously. We only process the data necessary to provide our services.

### What We Access
- **Product Data**: Titles, descriptions, prices, and inventory levels (to provide accurate answers).
- **Store Policy**: Shipping, return, and privacy policies you upload to the Knowledge Base.
- **Interaction Logs**: Anonymous chat logs to help you analyze customer intent.

### What We Do NOT Store
- **Customer Payment Info**: We never access or store credit card details.
- **Passwords**: We do not have access to customer account passwords.

## Security Infrastructure

Naridon is built on enterprise-grade infrastructure.

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Shopify Native**: We are an embedded Shopify App, meaning we leverage Shopify's secure authentication (OAuth) for admin access. We do not manage separate usernames/passwords for your staff.
- **LLM Security**: We use enterprise APIs from OpenAI and Anthropic which do not train their models on your API data (Zero Data Retention policies where applicable).

## Compliance

### GDPR & CCPA
Naridon is designed to be GDPR and CCPA compliant.
- **Right to Erasure**: When a customer requests data deletion via Shopify, we automatically purge associated chat logs and data.
- **Data Processing Agreement**: Our terms include standard DPA clauses protecting your rights as a data controller.
