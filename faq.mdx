## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between SEO and AIO?">
    **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** helps you rank for keywords in traditional search engines like Google. 
    
    **AIO (AI Search Optimization)** helps you rank for *conversations* in AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. When a user asks an AI for a recommendation, AIO ensures your product is the answer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Naridon affect my store's speed?">
    **No.** Naridon runs on its own infrastructure (Vercel/AWS) and connects to your store via the Shopify API. It does not inject heavy scripts into your storefront theme, so it has zero impact on your site loading speed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to see results?">
    AI models update their knowledge at different rates.
    - **Real-time models** (Perplexity, Bing Chat, Google Gemini) can reflect changes within **24-48 hours**.
    - **Static models** (older GPT versions) may take weeks to update.
    
    Generally, our users see their first "AI Traffic" spikes within 14 days of optimizing their schema and content.

## Safety & Data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my data shared with other merchants?">
    **Never.** Your data is isolated and encrypted. We do not share your sales data or product strategies with other merchants.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Naridon use my data to train public AI models?">
    **No.** We use enterprise APIs from OpenAI and Anthropic with "Zero Data Retention" policies. This means your data is used *only* to generate answers for you and is not used to train their public models.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will the AI hallucinate about my products?">
    We use a technique called **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** which grounds the AI in your actual product data. While no AI is 100% perfect, this drastically reduces the chance of hallucinations. You also have full control to review and edit any content before it goes live.
  </Accordion>
