## The War Room

The **War Room** is your command center for market intelligence. It allows you to see exactly how you stack up against competitors when customers ask AI models for recommendations.

## Key Metrics

### Share of Voice
This percentage represents how often your brand is mentioned or recommended across all the prompts you are tracking.
- **Trend Line**: Track if your visibility is increasing or decreasing over the last 30 days.

### Keyword Dominance
Tracks your ranking position for your target keywords.
- **Won**: You rank #1-3.
- **At Risk**: You rank #4-10.
- **Lost**: You are not in the top 10 recommendations.

### Revenue Opportunity
An estimate of the monthly revenue you are losing due to low visibility on high-intent search queries.

## Competitor Tracking

Naridon automatically identifies competitors based on your product category and the brands that appear alongside you in search results.

### Threat Levels
- **High Threat**: Competitors that consistently outrank you on your core keywords.
- **Monitor**: Competitors that appear occasionally but don't currently dominate.

### Deep Dive
Click on any competitor to see:
- **Top Keywords**: The specific phrases they are winning.
- **Strategy**: AI-deduced strategy (e.g., "Aggressive discounting," "Sustainability focus").
- **Last Seen**: When they last appeared in a search result.

## Intelligence Feed

The Intel Feed provides real-time alerts about market shifts.

- **Competitor Gap**: "Brand X is ranking for 'vegan leather' and you are not."
- **Negative Sentiment**: "AI models are mentioning shipping delays associated with your brand."
- **Missed Trend**: "There is a spike in searches for 'purple widgets' which you sell but don't rank for."
