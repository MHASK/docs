## Beyond Basic Chatbots

Most Shopify chatbots are reactive—they wait for a customer to have a problem ("Where is my order?"). 

**Naridon Copilot is proactive.** It acts as a knowledgeable sales associate, greeting visitors with context and guiding them to purchase.

## The Traffic-to-Conversion Flywheel

1. **AIO Engine brings traffic**: Optimizing for high-intent prompts drives qualified visitors.
2. **Copilot closes the deal**: Copilot recognizes the context. If a user lands on a "sustainable shoes" page, Copilot says: *"Welcome! Looking for eco-friendly footwear? Here are our top picks."*
3. **Data Feedback**: Questions asked to Copilot are fed back into the AIO Engine to further optimize for external search.

## Key Features

### Proactive Greetings
Set up rules to engage customers based on:
- **Landing Page**: Tailor the message to the specific product or collection.
- **Referral Source**: Detect if they came from an AI search engine.
- **Time on Site**: Engage when a user shows dwell time but hasn't acted.

### Semantic Product Understanding
Copilot doesn't just search keywords. It understands your catalog.
- **Complex Queries**: Handles questions like *"Do you have something similar to this but in red and under $50?"*
- **Comparisons**: Can compare two products side-by-side for the customer.

### Brand-Aware Persona
Customize the AI's tone and style to match your brand voice.
- **Tone Settings**: Professional, Friendly, Witty, or Custom.
- **Guardrails**: Ensure the AI never hallucinates discounts or policies that don't exist.

1. **Customize Appearance**: Match your brand colors and logo.
