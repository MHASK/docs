## What is Copilot?

The **Copilot** is your store's dedicated AI agent. Unlike generic chatbots, Copilot is trained on your specific store data, policies, and brand voice. It powers the "Conversations" you see in the dashboard and can be used to simulate customer interactions or assist your support team.

## Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base is the brain of your Copilot. It aggregates data from multiple sources to create a complete understanding of your business.

### Data Sources
Naridon automatically indexes:
- **Products**: Full catalog details (titles, prices, specs).
- **Collections**: To understand site structure and product categorization.
- **Blog Posts**: Articles and guides are indexed to answer "how-to" questions.
- **Custom Knowledge**: You can manually add specific articles (e.g., "Return Policy," "Brand History") to train the Copilot on non-product information.

## Skills

Skills are specific capabilities enabled for your Copilot.
- **Product Recommendation**: Ability to suggest products based on complex user needs.
- **Policy Answers**: Ability to quote or summarize return/shipping policies.
- **Voice Navigator**: Powered by **GPT-4o Realtime Preview**, allowing for voice-based interactions (if enabled).

## Supported Models

The Copilot leverages a hybrid model approach for optimal speed and reasoning:
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: For complex reasoning and "Fix" generation.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp**: For ultra-fast text generation and summaries.
- **DeepSeek V3**: For high-volume analysis and cost-effective processing.
