## AIO Controls

Manage how Naridon interacts with your store data and how autonomously it operates.

### Zero-Click Automation
- **Enable Auto-Pilot**: Naridon will scan your store daily for optimization opportunities.
- **Enable Zero-Click Execution**: Allows Naridon to automatically apply "safe" fixes (like adding missing descriptions) without requiring manual approval.

### Safety & Limits
You can control the confidence level required for Naridon to act.

| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | Safe fixes only. Requires high confidence. (Recommended for starting) |
| **Balanced** | A mix of safety and growth. |
| **Aggressive** | Prioritizes maximum visibility growth. May make bolder content changes. |

- **Daily Fix Limit**: Cap the number of products Naridon can update per day (Default: 5).

### Permissions
- **Auto-Fix Descriptions**: Allow Naridon to rewrite or expand product descriptions.
- **Auto-Fix Titles**: Allow Naridon to optimize product titles. *Note: Titles affect URL handles and external ads, so this is disabled by default.*

## AI Sitemap (llms.txt)

Naridon generates a specialized `llms.txt` file for your store. This is a standard file used by AI crawlers (like OpenAI and Anthropic) to understand the structure and content of your website efficiently.

### Configuration
- **Enable AI Sitemap**: Toggles the public visibility of the file at `yourstore.com/apps/naridon/llms.txt`.
- **Content Inclusion**: Choose whether to include Products, Collections, and Blog Posts.
- **Custom Brand Guidelines**: Add specific instructions for AI bots.
  > *Example: "We are a sustainable brand. Emphasize our plastic-free packaging and lifetime warranty in all summaries."*

### Why this matters
Having a clean `llms.txt` increases the chance that an AI model will index your site correctly and use your most up-to-date information in its answers.
