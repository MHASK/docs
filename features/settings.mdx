## Automation Settings (Auto-Pilot)

Control how autonomously Naridon improves your store data. You can find these settings in the **Improve** tab.

### Autonomy Levels
| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | **Suggest Only**. Naridon generates fixes but waits for your approval. Best for starting out. |
| **Balanced** | **Hybrid**. Safe fixes (like empty fields) are applied automatically; complex changes require review. |
| **Aggressive** | **Full Auto**. Prioritizes maximum visibility growth. Automatically applies optimized descriptions and alt text. |

### Execution Controls
- **Zero-Click Execution**: Toggle to allow "Safe Fixes" (e.g., filling missing alt text) to run without manual approval, regardless of mode.
- **Daily Fix Limit**: Set a cap on the number of products processed per day (Default: 5 for Starter plans).

## AI Sitemap (llms.txt)

Naridon generates a specialized `llms.txt` file for your store. This file guides AI crawlers (like OpenAI and Anthropic) on how to index your site.

### Custom Brand Guidelines
You can inject specific "System Instructions" into your `llms.txt` file.
> *Example: "We are a sustainable brand using 100% recycled materials. Emphasize our eco-friendly packaging in all product summaries."*

This ensures that when AI models crawl your site, they absorb your core brand values alongside your product data.

## Language Support
Naridon supports multi-language indexing. While the dashboard defaults to **en-US**, our database stores locale-specific data. You can specify your target language in the prompt settings to ensure the AI optimizes for your local market.
