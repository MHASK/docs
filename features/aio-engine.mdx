## What is the AIO Engine?

The **AIO (AI Search Optimization) Engine** is the core of Naridon. It ensures your products are discovered, understood, and recommended by AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.

Just as SEO optimizes for Google's algorithm, AIO optimizes for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Semantic Knowledge Graph
Naridon builds a rich, structured data layer for your store that goes beyond basic keywords.
- **Product DNA**: We analyze material composition, use-cases (e.g., "good for flat feet"), and detailed specs.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Ensures AI models understand the *meaning* and *relationships* of your products, not just the text on the page.

### 2. Visibility Score & Rank Tracking
Quantify your brand's presence on AI platforms with a 0-100 score.
- **Platform Breakdown**: See how you rank specifically on ChatGPT vs. Perplexity vs. Claude.
- **Trend Analysis**: Track your visibility over time to measure improvement.

### 3. Prompt Monitoring
Track specific, high-intent user queries to see if your brand is the recommended answer.
- **Create Prompts**: Add queries like *"best sustainable running shoes under $150"* individually or via CSV bulk upload.
- **AI Suggestions**: Naridon scans your products and suggests high-value prompts you should be tracking.
- **Analysis Runs**: Trigger on-demand scans to see your current Rank, Sentiment, and Visibility Score.
- **Watchlist**: Pin your most critical prompts to the dashboard for daily monitoring.

### 4. Competitor Intelligence
Analyze how your competitors are being recommended in real-time.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare your Visibility Score against key competitors.
- **Strategy Adjustments**: Adjust your store's data signals to outrank competitors.
