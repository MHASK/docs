## Automated Health Checks

The **Auto-Pilot Fix Engine** is your store's 24/7 mechanic. It performs daily automated scans to ensure your data meets the strict standards of AI models.

## Key Functions

### 1. Schema Repair
Structured data (JSON-LD) is the language AI models speak. Naridon automatically:
- **Injects Missing Schema**: Adds Product, Review, and Organization schema where missing.
- **Corrects Errors**: Fixes validation errors that prevent Google and AI models from parsing your data.
- **Updates Standards**: Keeps your schema up-to-date with the latest Schema.org requirements.

### 2. Content Enrichment
AI models ignore "thin" content. Naridon detects products with sparse descriptions and:
- **Suggests Improvements**: Generates AI-optimized descriptions highlighting key features.
- **Expands Attributes**: Adds detailed attributes (material, dimensions, care instructions) that users often search for.

### 3. Daily Scans
You don't need to remember to check your store's health.
- **Automated**: Runs every 24 hours.
- **Alerts**: Notifies you of critical issues that need manual approval.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically fixes low-risk issues without requiring your input.

3. **One-Click Apply**: Accept AI suggestions with a single click to instantly update your Shopify store.
