## The "Improve" Module

The **Improve** tab is your home for optimization. It houses the **Fix Engine**, which performs daily automated scans to ensure your data meets the strict standards of AI models.

## New Fix Types

Naridon now supports a wider range of optimizations:

### 1. Vision AI Alt Text
Using **GPT-4o** and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, Naridon analyzes your product images pixel-by-pixel to generate descriptive, context-aware Alt Text.
- **Benefit**: Helps AI models "see" your products and improves accessibility.

### 2. Schema Injector
We automatically generate and inject **JSON-LD Structured Data** for:
- **Products**: Price, availability, ratings.
- **Brands**: Logo, description, social links.
- **Offers**: Merchant listings and shipping details.

### 3. Meta Tag Optimization
Naridon rewrites your SEO Title and Meta Descriptions to be more conversational and "clickable" for AI search results.

## Optimization Workflow

1.  **Review Opportunities**: In the **Improve** tab, see a prioritized list of "Product Gaps".
2.  **Generate Fix**: Click to have the AI draft a new description, alt text, or schema.
3.  **Publish**:
    *   **Manual**: Review the draft and click "Publish".
    *   **Auto-Pilot**: If enabled (Balanced/Aggressive mode), safe fixes are applied automatically.

## Daily Limits
Depending on your plan, you have a specific "Fix Volume" per month (e.g., 100 for Starter, 500 for Growth). You can set a daily limit in Settings to spread these out.
