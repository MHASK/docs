## Automated Health Checks

The **Auto-Pilot Fix Engine** is your store's 24/7 mechanic. It performs daily automated scans to ensure your data meets the strict standards of AI models.

## Key Functions

### 1. Schema Repair
Structured data (JSON-LD) is the language AI models speak. Naridon automatically:
- **Injects Missing Schema**: Adds Product, Review, and Organization schema where missing.
- **Corrects Errors**: Fixes validation errors that prevent Google and AI models from parsing your data.
- **Updates Standards**: Keeps your schema up-to-date with the latest Schema.org requirements.

### 2. Content Enrichment
AI models require rich content. Naridon detects products with sparse descriptions and:
- **Suggests Improvements**: Generates AI-optimized descriptions highlighting key features.
- **Expands Attributes**: Adds detailed attributes that users often search for.

## Optimization Hub Workflow

1. **Review Recommendations**: Naridon groups opportunities by priority.
2. **Generate Draft**: Use the AI to write optimized content.
3. **Review & Compare**: See a side-by-side comparison of your original content vs. the AI proposal.
4. **Publish**: Update your live site with the optimized content.

## Auto-Pilot Settings
You can configure how autonomously the Fix Engine operates in the **[Configuration](/features/settings)** menu.
- **Conservative Mode**: Only suggests changes; you must approve everything.
- **Zero-Click Execution**: Automatically publishes safe fixes (like filling in empty descriptions) to save you time.
